Hello, it's me: weird programmer, I know.

You're likely looking for my main website ([right here](https://plasma4.github.io/my-site/)). I program mostly in JavaScript, although I have dabbled in other programming languages like Java, JavaScript, C/C++, and Python.

I've made:
* An interactive fractal viewer
* A big numbers site
* Some weird HTML games
* ...other stuff

That's about it, I guess! Start exploring!
