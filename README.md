Hello, it's me: weird programmer, I know.

You're likely looking for my main website ([right here](https://plasma4.github.io/my-site/)). I program mostly in JavaScript, although I have dabbled in other programming languages like Java, JavaScript, C/C++, and Python.

I've made:
* [An interactive fractal viewer](https://plasma4.github.io/my-site/fractal.html)
* [A big numbers site](https://plasma4.github.io/my-site/numbers.html)
* Some weird HTML games (like [this insanity](https://plasma4.github.io/my-site/clocks.html))
* [A high-precision large number system](https://github.com/plasma4/hyper-number/tree/main)
* ...other stuff

That's about it, I guess! Start exploring!
